This is a web application which provides a platform for players to buy and play games hosted by third-party servers. Developers 
add games to the site by posting a URL to the game, which is then included as a iframe in a parent HTML. Players can access the game
after buying it. 

The website details can be found in the file DOCUMENTATION.docx. The application has been built using Django and other web technologies such as HTML5/CSS and JavaScript.
The application has been deployed on Heroku.
